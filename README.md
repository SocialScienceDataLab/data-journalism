# Telling Stories with Data: Insights into Data Journalism

📍 virtual MZES, Mannheim

📆 May 26, 2021

Data journalism is all about using and presenting data in a way that readers will intuitively understand them. In this event, we will talk about examples of data-driven stories in order to demonstrate how journalists tell stories using data, what the obstacles are to a good data-driven story and what scientists and journalists can learn from each other regarding data storytelling.
